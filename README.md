# WorkoutBuilder
A simple web-app for creating, viewing, uploading, and sharing a workout plan.
After signing up, a user can create a custom workout - complete with a name, classification, and a multitude of exercises.
A user can opt to share their workout, where it is viewable by the entire community.

This app was produced as the final project portion of the Harvard University CS50x course.

## The website is currently hosted at Heroku:

If you would prefer to use a filesystem instead of signed cookies - uncomment line '28-33'. Otherwise, leave unchanged.
